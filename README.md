# alexa-thermostat

Simple Alexa skills app to request and set the current temperature and target temperature on
a filtret CT50 thermostat.

The request is sent to my thermostat via a Dynamic DNS and my router port forwards to
my internal thermostat's IP address.

This code is a mis mash of other code I found while researching building an Alexa Skill.

Big thanks to Matt Kruse for alexa-app. alexa-app makes the process of writing alexa skills simple.
