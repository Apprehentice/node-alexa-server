# alexa-thermostat

Simple Alexa skills app to request the current temperature and target temperature on
a filtret CT50 thermostat. I have this hosted on heroku due to the SSL requirements of
amazon.

The request is sent to my thermostat via a Dynamic DNS and my router port forwards to
my internal thermostat's IP address.

This code is a mis mash of other code I found while researching building an Alexa Skill
